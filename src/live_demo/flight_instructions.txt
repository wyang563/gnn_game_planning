Configuring drone URI:
1 - run cfclient in terminal
2 - go to connect button IN THE WINDOW to connect drone to computer
3 - use usb cable to plug into the drone to the laptop
4 - then use the connect button ON THE TOP TAB 
5 - there should be a hex address corresponding with the drone that appears
6 - copy paste so the address looks something like this (remove the "0x") hex prefix when using your address
"radio://0/80/2M/E7E7E7E708"

you must have cfclient running in a terminal window before you run your flight script to coordinate drones
